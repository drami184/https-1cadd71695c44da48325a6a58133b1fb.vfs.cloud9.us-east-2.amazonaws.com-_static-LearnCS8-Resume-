        <p class="lead mb-4">My biggest challenge has been communication when I need help. My parents would nag at me to speak up whenever we went to family reunions or greeted people at church on Sunday morning services. In school, it was the same thing. Even if I really wanted to ask a question, I never wanted to raise my hand because I did not have the courage to do it. As much as I respect my teachers and respect their work, it felt weird for me to talk casually to them since I was taught this was a sign of disrespect. At the start of my freshman year of high school, I built up the courage to ask my history teacher for help on a content assessment. After we worked together, she asked me how my day was so far and talked to me about life. Seeing how a small conversation with her made me feel made me want to change the way I communicated. It made me feel special, appreciated, and like I could open up to other teachers or students at this new school. She also asked me if I had any questions about class, which to be honest, not a single teacher in elementary or middle school had ever genuinely asked me. These conversations had a significant impact on me later in high school. I figured out how to be more involved in my community and get out of my comfort zone. Now that I am seventeen with a couple months left before I graduate from high school, I have become more aware of who I am now. I go to office hours when I need help from my teachers, and I decided to co-create a human rights club with my friend. I hope one day in person I can thank my history teacher, who is also my mentor, on helping me become more confident in talking with others. She is very dedicated to making sure students like me are doing well in school and getting good grades, and I have learned a lot about how to overcome my fears. <br><br>

        During virtual school, my parents were really busy at work and he needed someone older to be in his parent/teacher conferences, so with no hesitation I took the role and chatted with his teachers. Before getting ready for the zoom call, I was getting nervous because I thought there were going to be some different teachers that I never knew since I used to go to the same middle school as he is right now. They were my old middle school teachers and I was kind of embarrassed seeing them for the first time. They were glad that my brother had someone they can rely on with schoolwork and know I can help him with homework. We were discussing how my brother and I also have some things in common such as being responsible with our work and being committed to get work done before class ends. After that zoom meeting with his teachers I really didn't think too much about it. A few moments later it actually hit me. Just by doing my parents' role for a parent/teacher conference, this made me realize that I have led and mentored my brother for a long time. I was glad how the teachers were really giving compliments to him and really believe that he will do better later in the year. While balancing school work and doing chores around the house in my last year of high school, it's hard for me to check up on my brother at his school work from time to time. Recently we got an email showing his school report of the trimester and I was proud of him that he tried his best and did really well for only being a few months into school. Although my brother does not give a lot of appreciation for me, he expresses himself in a very mean sibling manner and that is what will make me remember him as we grow up into adulthood. Iâ€™m happy to say that my brother has shaped me to become a good leader.<br><br>
